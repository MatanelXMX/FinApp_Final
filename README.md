# **FinApp** by M&D
A small tracking App developed for C.Sci. Project instead of Exam.
Written in CPP. Uses ImGui with GLFW+OpenGL3, as well as httpslib, SSL and ImPlot.

# Project Requirements
## Basic tech. req.
* use of STLs s.a. Vectors and UnorderedMaps
* use of \<filesystem\>, \<fstream\>
* use of Threads & Atomic/Mutex
* 3rd party libs
	* nlohmann for JSON parsing
 	* CPP-Httplib for HTTP/S requests
  	* Dear ImGui for UI/UX

## Operational req.
* sending an HTTP/S request to WWW retirieve JSON data. can use free APIs from the web.
the downloaded data shall be processed and presented somehow to the user.
* User GUI: based on ImGui. shall show the downloaded data somehow, and let the user to interact with it and the UI.
